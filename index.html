    <h1>Lions</h1>
    <p>Lions are found throughout Africa, are endangered and vulnerable.  These animals live in groups of as many as 30 lions, and this is is referred to as a <em>pride</em>. They work together as a team to ensure the survival of the pride.  The average life-span of a lion is 10-14 years, and they can run up to 50 miles per hour.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Male lions can be distinguished from their female counter-parts through their manes.  The females are the ones often hunting and providing for the pride.  A lion can eat over <strong>60 pounds</strong> of food in one meal!</p>
